This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors of column names. When a specified column name is missing, the subsetting operation silently ignores it instead of producing an error, potentially leading to incorrect results and difficult-to-debug issues. The `bug.R` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.R` provides a solution using more robust subsetting methods to avoid silent failures.
